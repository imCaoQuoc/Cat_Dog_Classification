# CAT AND DOG CLASSIFICATION USING MOBILET NET V2

This project aims to develop an animal (Dog and Cat) classification system using MobileNet V2 deep learning models. The system can determine whether an image is a dog or a cat.

### **INTRODUCTION**
"Cat and Dog Classification" is a branch of computer vision focused on training models to differentiate between images of cats and dogs. This involves teaching machines to automatically recognize visual features and make accurate predictions. Beyond the adorable context of pets, this task has applications in security, wildlife monitoring, and automated image recognition systems.

Technologies I used:
  - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to create a simple web demo.
  - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to build a deep learning model.
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org) process image and array.
  - [Streamlit documentation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtqF5YXg7GLmCvTswG32NqQypOuYkPRUE) to learn the basic of streamlit.

### **INSTALLATION**
I highly recommend you using Google Colab to run the dogcat_classification.ipynb file because it already has packages and libraries I use. But if you want to run on your local machine, following the instruction below.
  - Install essential libraries and packages:
  
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### **DATA INFORMATION** 

This data 2 classes: Dog and Cat. Each class include around 2500 images.

### **MOBILE NET V2**

MobileNet V2 is a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for computer vision tasks. MobileNet V2 utilizes depthwise separable convolutions, making it ideal for applications on mobile devices and embedded systems. With its compact design and impressive performance, MobileNet V2 is a popular choice for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. This README provides an overview of using MobileNet V2 for the task of animal classification.
